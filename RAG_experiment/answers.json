        "answer": "形式化软件工程（Formal Software Engineering）并非直接在给出的论文摘要中提及的主题。但从上下文推测，它可能与教育和数学思维的培养有关。在论文的讨论中，作者关注的是如何通过数学教育，特别是理论构建（theory building），培养学生的逻辑思维和问题解决能力，这在软件工程中是一项关键技能。理论构建部分可能涉及形式化方法，即运用数学和逻辑工具来系统地描述、分析和验证软件系统的结构和行为。虽然论文聚焦于几何领域，但其目标是为跨学科的框架提供启示，这框架可能有助于培养对所有人（包括软件工程师）在个人、公共和职业生活中都重要的思考能力。因此，形式化软件工程可能是指在教学中运用形式化方法来提升软件开发过程的严谨性和效率。",

In\n2022, she proposed that: (1) when explaining the knowledge points of frequency\nin the \"Sound\" unit, experiments on the vibration of objects such as rubber\nbands and steel rulers were used to assist students in learning, but the effect\nwas not obvious, because it was difficult for the naked eye to distinguish the\nspeed of vibration of objects such as rubber bands, and it was difficult to\ncorrespond to the high and low frequencies; (2) Students seem to be confused\nabout the difference between frequency and amplitude. When guiding them to make\nthe rubber band vibrate faster, they tend to tug harder at the rubber band, but\nthis actually changes the amplitude rather than the frequency (changing the\nfrequency should be to control its vibrating chord length, similar to the\ntuning method of a stringed instrument). Therefore, demonstration experiments\nusing objects such as rubber bands as frequencies do not seem suitable and\ncannot effectively assist students in establishing the concept of frequency. We\nhope to solicit opinions and solutions (research ideas) on this problem, with a\nfocus on two points: (1) the mathematical/physical explanation of the problem.\nThat is, does simply changing the amplitude really not affect the original\nvibration frequency of the object (except when the amplitude is 0) (2)\nexplanation from a cognitive perspective: Why do people confuse the two\nconcepts?
